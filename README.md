MediCare is a hospital management system aimed at connecting the patients and doctors of the hospital via a handy interface, 
making it easy for the patients to book appointments, get their problems solved and for the doctors to attend to their patients 
without having to worry too much about scheduling appointments and also make the administration for the hospital efficient.
